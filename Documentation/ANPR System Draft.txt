//UPLOAD IMAGE OF CAR

//FOR DETECTION

-we have used a classifier - haar cascade
haar cascade is a ML based model which is trained on tons of dataset and hence can detect objects from an image. In our case, it will detect number plate from the input image.
-you can use YOLO as well, but we have used Haarcascade for simplification of code.

we can create extra utilities by making a dictionary of all state with codes.

//FOR CONVERSION

image reading = cv2(Open CV computer vision library/Most powerful/contains 1000s of algorithms for identificication/Built in C, C++

we have used techniques like gray conversion for converting the input image into grayscale and then performing required operations
making black and white image.

DETECTION:
1.1,4 good neighbour values for number plate detection

#Cropping number plate ->changing brightness and threshhold/sharpening
-using dilate and erode of cv2 then converting again to b/w
-applying threshold

//FOR RECOGNITION
-you can use deep learning, CNN etc
-we are using pre-trained OCR engine built by open source contributors
-using "image_to_string " to convert all content into text

- use string processing to eliminate the extra characters
//FOR DISPLAY
